        "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in automating tasks and driving decision-making within enterprise systems has led to growing concerns over the significant energy consumption involved in model training and inference processes. This paper introduces an innovative framework focused on optimizing energy efficiency in AI models, all while preserving high performance. The system employs advanced optimization algorithms aimed at minimizing energy usage during both AI training and inference, ensuring minimal impact on model accuracy. A dynamic, multi-objective optimization approach is used to achieve an optimal balance between energy reduction and performance, identifying Pareto-optimal solutions tailored to various operational needs. Validated within large-scale enterprise settings, the system delivers a 30.6\\% decrease in overall energy consumption, with only a slight 0.7\\% reduction in model accuracy. Furthermore, scalability is demonstrated through a 5.0\\% improvement in task execution time and a 4.8\\% increase in system throughput. The findings highlight the practicality of this framework for promoting sustainable AI deployment, aiding both cost efficiency and environmental responsibility. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and outlining potential avenues for future research to further enhance scalability and broaden the framework\u2019s application.",

Despite the enthusiasm surrounding AI\u2019s potential, concerns persist about its potential negative impacts, including substantial energy consumption and ethical challenges. This paper critically reviews the evolving landscape of AI sustainability, addressing economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The literature is systematically categorized into \u201cSustainability of AI\u201d and \u201cAI for Sustainability\u201d, revealing a balanced perspective between the two. The study also identifies a notable trend towards holistic approaches, with a surge in publications and empirical studies since 2019, signaling the field\u2019s maturity. Future research directions emphasize delving into the relatively under-explored economic dimension, aligning with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and addressing stakeholders\u2019 influence.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving set of technologies used for solving a wide range of applied issues. The core of AI is machine learning (ML)\u2014a complex of algorithms and methods that address the problems of classification, clustering, and forecasting. The practical application of AI\\&ML holds promising prospects. Therefore, the researches in this area are intensive. However, the industrial applications of AI and its more intensive use in society are not widespread at the present time. The challenges of widespread AI applications need to be considered from both the AI (internal problems) and the societal (external problems) perspective. This consideration will identify the priority steps for more intensive practical application of AI technologies, their introduction, and involvement in industry and society. The article presents the identification and discussion of the challenges of the employment of AI technologies in the economy and society of resource-based countries. The systematization of AI\\&ML technologies is implemented based on publications in these areas. This systematization allows for the specification of the organizational, personnel, social and technological limitations. This paper outlines the directions of studies in AI and ML, which will allow us to overcome some of the limitations and achieve expansion of the scope of AI\\&ML applications.",

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.",

However, the massive computation required to obtain these exciting results is costly both financially, due to the price of specialized hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and to the environment, as a result of non-renewable energy used to fuel modern tensor processing hardware.

        "abstract": "While there is a growing effort towards AI for Sustainability (e.g.\u00a0towards the sustainable development goals) it is time to move beyond that and to address the sustainability of developing and using AI systems. In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI for sustainability and sustainability of AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment\u2014to remember that there are environmental costs to AI. Further, to direct funding towards sustainable methods of AI.",

        "abstract": "With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this article, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115\\%, with savings over 50\\% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.

This energy-intensive workload has seen immense growth in recent years. Machine learning (ML) may become a significant contributor to climate change if this exponential trend continues. If practitioners are aware of their energy and carbon footprint, then they may actively take steps to reduce it whenever possible. In this work, we present Carbontracker, a tool for tracking and predicting the energy and carbon footprint of training DL models.
